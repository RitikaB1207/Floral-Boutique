<h1>Every flower is a soul blossoming in nature</h1>
<p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms).
The biological function of a flower is to affect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.
Flowers may facilitate outcrossing resulting from cross pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower)when self pollination occurs.
Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy).
Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. 
Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen.
After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seed</p>
<h1>Floral parts</h1>
<p>The essential parts of a flower can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting of petals and associated structures in the perianth, and the reproductive or sexual parts.
A stereotypical flower consists of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk.
Each of these kinds of parts is arranged in a whorl on the receptacle.</p>

<h2>Floral Function</h2>
<p>The principal purpose of a flower is the reproduction of the individual and the species.
All flowering plants are heterosporous, that is, every individual plant produces two types of spores.
Microspores are produced by meiosis inside anthers and megaspores are produced inside ovules that are within an ovary.
Anthers typically consist of four microsporangia and an ovule is an integumented megasporangium.
Both types of spores develop into gametophytes inside sporangia.
As with all heterosporous plants, the gametophytes also develop inside the spores, i. e., they are endosporic.</p>
<h2>Evolution of flowers</h2>
<p>While land plants have existed for about 425 million years, the first ones reproduced by a simple adaptation of their aquatic counterparts: spores.
In the sea, plants—and some animals—can simply scatter out genetic clones of themselves to float away and grow elsewhere.
This is how early plants reproduced.
But plants soon evolved methods of protecting these copies to deal with drying out and other damage which is even more likely on land than in the sea.
The protection became the seed, though it had not yet evolved the flower.
Early seed-bearing plants include the ginkgo and conifers.</p>
<h2>Color of flowers</h2>
<p>Many flowering plants reflect as much light as possible within the range of visible wavelengths of the pollinator the plant intends to attract. Flowers that reflect the full range of visible light are generally perceived as white by a human observer. An important feature of white flowers is that they reflect equally across the visible spectrum. While many flowering plants use white to attract pollinators, the use of color is also widespread (even within the same species). Color allows a flowering plant to be more specific about the pollinator it seeks to attract. </p>
